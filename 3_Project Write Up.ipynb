    "\n",
    "I work for a nonprofit organization (buildOn) that seeks to increase the number of major grants (\\\\$10k+) and transformative grants ($100k+) our organization applies for and wins. Using a database of grants made in 2021 and 2022 (downloaded from the Candid Foundation Directory), I used topic modeling algorithms to identify giving trends, and explore differences among grants of different amounts. This information can inform our fundraising teamâ€™s grant writing strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing Candid Foundation Directory's grant database, I pulled every grant authorized from 2021-2022 under the education category where the recipient was located in one of our program locations. Utilizing NMF topic modeling algorithms, I identified 10 topics among the major and transformational grant corpus showing more tactical funding (operational expenses) for major grants and more topical funding (programs tackling issues like early childhood education) for transformational grants. I further filtered these datasets to identify topics relevent to buildOn, and then identified 10 total recommended grantmakers for prospecting based on their TFIDF topic scores. "
